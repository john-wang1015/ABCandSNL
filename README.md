# Calibrating Voronoi cell-based model by SMC-ABC and SNL
This repo contains a Python and C++ implementation for following papers:
- [Calibration of a Voronoi cell-based model for tumour growth using approximate Bayesian computation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.13.507714v3.abstract)
- Being Bayesian in the 2020s: opportunities and challenges in the practice of modern applied Bayesian statistics

by Xiaoyu Wang, [Adrianne L. Jenner](https://www.adriannejenner.com/), [Robert Salomone](https://robsalomone.com/) and [Christopher Drovandi](https://chrisdrovandi.weebly.com/)

The code to simulate the VCBM originates from [Examining the efficacy of localised gemcitabine therapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer using a hybrid agent-based model](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.18.488716v1.abstract)
