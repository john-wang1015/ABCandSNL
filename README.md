The code to simulate the VCBM originates from [Examining the efficacy of localised gemcitabine therapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer using a hybrid agent-based model](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.18.488716v1.abstract)
***
Agent-based models are a class of models that can describe complicated phenomena by analysing the interactions between each agent. In cellular dynamics, treating each cell as an agent is a popular strategy. Prior research has sometimesÂ ignored the geometries of agents and only considered their interactions. In the Voronoi cell-based model, the agent is modelled with Voronoi tesselation so that its shape is as accurate as reality.

In this work, we use sequential Monte Carlo - approximate Bayeisan computation (SMC-ABC) and sequential neural likelihood method to quantify the uncertainty of the model paramters.
